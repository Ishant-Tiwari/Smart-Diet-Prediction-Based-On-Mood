# Smart-Diet-Prediction-Based-On-Mood

Smart Diet Prediction Based On Mood
📌 Project Overview
Smart Diet Prediction Based On Mood is a data science project that analyzes food nutritional values and aims to recommend or understand dietary patterns based on mood-related data. The project leverages Python and common machine learning libraries to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and basic statistical analysis on a dataset (food.csv).

📁 Dataset
The project uses a dataset named food.csv which includes various nutritional features of food items such as:

Calories

Protein

Fat

Carbohydrates

Sugar

Fiber

The file is uploaded manually into the Colab notebook for processing.

⚙️ Steps Performed
✅ 1. Library Imports
Essential libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib were imported for data handling and visualization.

✅ 2. Data Loading
The food.csv file was uploaded using Google Colab’s file upload interface.

The dataset was then read into a DataFrame using pandas.

✅ 3. Data Exploration
Previewed the first few rows using head().

Displayed dataset information like column names, data types, and null values with info().

✅ 4. Data Visualization
Created histograms to understand the distribution of numerical features.

Used box plots to identify outliers and analyze the spread of nutritional features.

📊 Technologies Used
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

Matplotlib

Numpy
